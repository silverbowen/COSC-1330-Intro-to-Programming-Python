## This program gets a series of English measurements and converts them
## into Metric measurements. It uses error checking to prevent invalid inputs,
## and in the event of an invalid input it ends.

## In addition, this version asks the user for their name and their email address
## before displaying the results of the conversions. It searches the input string for
## the @ symbol. If the symbol is not found, it asks the user to re-enter their email
## address. Finally, it includes the userâ€™s name in the conversion output.
